    title: Welcome!
    text: Hey! Welcome to my website, my name's Mike. I'm a 24 year old software developer
     from Chester County PA, and this website should give you an idea of some of the stuff 
     I've done, and the stuff I'm currently working on! I love programming, and I especially love
     writing clean and beautiful code that doesn't look like a glob of spaghetti. I've build several
     full stack web apps, and worked at a few different companies. I really love user interface design,
     and front end stuff in general! Take a look for yourself and feel free to contact me with any 
     questions / offers!
